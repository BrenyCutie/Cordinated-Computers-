    <h1>What are we ?</h1>
    <p1>Cordinated Computers was founded by four college students who were ambitious to show the power of technology to the world. 
      <br> </br>
    At Co-ordinated Computers, we hope to make the future bright for our youth and help in the reduction of waste that plagues our planet Earth.
      We salvage old computer parts from unused PCs and use them to produce brand new computer systems and we donate all our products to rural and disadvantaged areas, especially schools, to help establish expertise in computers in the general public and help people get into jobs involving computer systems.
    </p1>

    <div class="head2">
      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p1>We want to ensure all children have equal opportunity succeeding in school regardless of income and where they’re from. Having access to technology is essential in today’s learning environment. It keeps students involved and provides a wealth of educational resources. We want to bridge the digital divide and provide for those who don’t have access to IT equipment. 
      <br></br>We also provide technology to disadvantaged areas and rural areas to allow the population to stay connected to the new world.</p1>

    <div class ="head3">
      <h1>What we do</h1>
      <p1>We take damaged or unwanted equipment and give them a second life. Our team refurbishes them and wipes them completely of any data. We take these devices and donate them to people in need so we can change their school life for the best. According to Camara Ireland 58% of DEIS students in Ireland don’t have a laptop available to them for schoolwork. We aim to abolish this educational disadvantage, and do it in a sustainable manner.
        <br></br> We give everyone young and old the oppertunities that technology brings.
